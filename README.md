# FileChat-RAG

FileChat-RAG is a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows users to ask questions about the contents of various file formats. It extracts text from PDFs, JSON, text files(.txt, .doc, .docx, .md), and code files, then enables interactive conversations using an LLM powered by Ollama.

## Features
- Supports text extraction from:
  - **PDFs** (.pdf)
  - **Text files** (.txt, .doc, .docx, .md)
  - **JSON files** (.json)
  - **Code files** (.py, .cpp, .java)
- Uses FAISS for efficient text retrieval
- Enables conversational interaction with documents
- Works with Ollama LLM (Gemma 3:1B by default)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Ollama installed ([installation guide](https://ollama.com/))
- Required Python packages:
  
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
  *(For GPU acceleration, install `faiss-gpu` instead of `faiss-cpu`)*

## Usage
### Installing and running Ollama Server
- Install Ollama Server:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```
- Ensure the LLM is present inside the Ollama Server:
```sh
ollama pull gemma3:1b
```
- Ensure the Embedding Model is present inside the Ollama Server:
```sh
ollama pull all-minilm
```
- Ensure that the Ollama server is running:

```sh
ollama serve &
```

### Run FileChat-RAG
To interact with a specific file, use:

```sh
python main.py --path /path/to/your/file.pdf
```

Example:

```sh
python main.py --path ./sample.pdf
```
```sh
python main.py --path ./sample.json
```
```sh
python main.py --path ./sample.txt
```
```sh
python main.py --path ./sample.py
```

### Interactive Chat
```sh
python main.py --path Book_TheEngineersPlan.pdf
```
Once the script starts, you can ask questions about the file content:

```
Ask me anything! (Type /quit to exit) >>> What is the summary of the book- The Engineer's Plan ?
>>> [AI-generated response]
```
